1. definitions.
1.2. "contributor version" means the combination of the original code, prior modifications used by a contributor, and the modifications made by that particular contributor.
1.3. "covered code" means the original code or modifications or the combination of the original code and modifications, in each case including portions thereof.
1.4. "electronic distribution mechanism" means a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data.
1.5. "executable" means covered code in any form other than source code.
1.6. "initial developer" means the individual or entity identified as the initial developer in the source code notice required by exhibit a.
1.7. "larger work" means a work which combines covered code or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this license.
1.8. "license" means this document.
1.9. "modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the substance or structure of either the original code or any previous modifications. when covered code is released as a series of files, a modification is:
a. any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing original code or previous modifications.
b. any new file that contains any part of the original code or previous modifications.
1.10. "original code" means source code of computer software code which is described in the source code notice required by exhibit a as original code, and which, at the time of its release under this license is not already covered code governed by this license.
1.11. "source code" means the preferred form of the covered code for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable, or a list of source code differential comparisons against either the original code or another well known, available covered code of the contributor's choice. the source code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.
1.12. "you" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this license or a future version of this license issued under section 6.1. for legal entities, "you" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. for purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.
2. source code license.
(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the original code (or portions thereof) with or without modifications, or as part of a larger work; and
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by initial developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("utilize") the original code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable you to utilize the original code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to utilize further modifications or combinations.
2.2. contributor grant.
each contributor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:
(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the modifications created by such contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other modifications, as covered code or as part of a larger work; and
(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by contributor, to utilize the contributor version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable you to utilize the contributor version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to utilize further modifications or combinations.
3. distribution obligations.
3.2. availability of source code.
any modification which you create or to which you contribute must be made available in source code form under the terms of this license either on the same media as an executable version or via an accepted electronic distribution mechanism to anyone to whom you made an executable version available; and if made available via electronic distribution mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular modification has been made available to such recipients. you are responsible for ensuring that the source code version remains available even if the electronic distribution mechanism is maintained by a third party.
3.3. description of modifications.
you must cause all covered code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes you made to create that covered code and the date of any change. you must include a prominent statement that the modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from original code provided by the initial developer and including the name of the initial developer in (a) the source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the covered code.
3.4. intellectual property matters
(a) third party claims.
if you have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this license), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "legal" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. if you obtain such knowledge after you make your modification available as described in section 3.2, you shall promptly modify the legal file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the covered code that new knowledge has been obtained.
(b) contributor apis.
if your modification is an application programming interface and you own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that api, you must also include this information in the legal file.
3.5. required notices.
you must duplicate the notice in exhibit a in each file of the source code, and this license in any documentation for the source code, where you describe recipients' rights relating to covered code. if you created one or more modification(s), you may add your name as a contributor to the notice described in exhibit a. if it is not possible to put such notice in a particular source code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. you may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of covered code. however, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the initial developer or any contributor. you must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the initial developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by the initial developer or such contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.
3.6. distribution of executable versions.
you may distribute covered code in executable form only if the requirements of section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that covered code, and if you include a notice stating that the source code version of the covered code is available under the terms of this license, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of section 3.2. the notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version, related documentation or collateral in which you describe recipients' rights relating to the covered code. you may distribute the executable version of covered code under a license of your choice, which may contain terms different from this license, provided that you are in compliance with the terms of this license and that the license for the executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the source code version from the rights set forth in this license. if you distribute the executable version under a different license you must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this license are offered by you alone, not by the initial developer or any contributor. you hereby agree to indemnify the initial developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by the initial developer or such contributor as a result of any such terms you offer.
3.7. larger works.
you may create a larger work by combining covered code with other code not governed by the terms of this license and distribute the larger work as a single product. in such a case, you must make sure the requirements of this license are fulfilled for the covered code.
4. inability to comply due to statute or regulation.
if it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this license with respect to some or all of the covered code due to statute or regulation then you must: (a) comply with the terms of this license to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. such description must be included in the legal file described in section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the source code. except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5. application of this license.
6. versions of the license.
6.2. effect of new versions.
once covered code has been published under a particular version of the license, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. you may also choose to use such covered code under the terms of any subsequent version of the license published by netscape. no one other than netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to covered code created under this license.
6.3. derivative works.
if you create or use a modified version of this license (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already covered code governed by this license), you must (a) rename your license so that the phrases "mozilla", "mozillapl", "mozpl", "netscape", "npl" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the mozilla public license and netscape public license. (filling in the name of the initial developer, original code or contributor in the notice described in exhibit a shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this license.)
7. disclaimer of warranty.
8. termination.
9. limitation of liability.
10. u.s. government end users.
11. miscellaneous.
12. responsibility for claims.
