angle brackets hold "fields", e.g. <copyright holder>.
square brackets hold optional text, e.g. [or <related entities>].
a license can have variations in capitalization and whitespace, and still be considered an instance of this template.
it may be possible to construct a grammatically incorrect license from this template, or one that lacks a disclaimer, or one that includes a double-disclaimer. that is acceptable, as long as it remains impossible to construct a non-osd-compliant license that matches the pattern.
