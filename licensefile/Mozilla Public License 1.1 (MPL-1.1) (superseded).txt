3. distribution obligations. 
3.2. availability of source code.
	any modification which you create or to which you contribute must be made available in source code form under the terms of this license either on the same media as an executable version or via an accepted electronic distribution mechanism to anyone to whom you made an executable version available; and if made available via electronic distribution mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular modification has been made available to such recipients. you are responsible for ensuring that the source code version remains available even if the electronic distribution mechanism is maintained by a third party. 
3.3. description of modifications.
	you must cause all covered code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes you made to create that covered code and the date of any change. you must include a prominent statement that the modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from original code provided by the initial developer and including the name of the initial developer in (a) the source code, and (b) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the covered code. 
3.4. intellectual property matters 
(b) contributor apis.
		if contributor's modifications include an application programming interface and contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that api, contributor must also include this information in the legal file.
		 
3.5. required notices.
	you must duplicate the notice in exhibit a in each file of the source code.  if it is not possible to put such notice in a particular source code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  if you created one or more modification(s) you may add your name as a contributor to the notice described in exhibit a.  you must also duplicate this license in any documentation for the source code where you describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to covered code.  you may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of covered code. however, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the initial developer or any contributor. you must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the initial developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by the initial developer or such contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer. 
3.6. distribution of executable versions.
	you may distribute covered code in executable form only if the requirements of section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that covered code, and if you include a notice stating that the source code version of the covered code is available under the terms of this license, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of section 3.2. the notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version, related documentation or collateral in which you describe recipients' rights relating to the covered code. you may distribute the executable version of covered code or ownership rights under a license of your choice, which may contain terms different from this license, provided that you are in compliance with the terms of this license and that the license for the executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the source code version from the rights set forth in this license. if you distribute the executable version under a different license you must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this license are offered by you alone, not by the initial developer or any contributor. you hereby agree to indemnify the initial developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by the initial developer or such contributor as a result of any such terms you offer. 
3.7. larger works.
	you may create a larger work by combining covered code with other code not governed by the terms of this license and distribute the larger work as a single product. in such a case, you must make sure the requirements of this license are fulfilled for the covered code.
4. inability to comply due to statute or regulation. 
5. application of this license. 
6. versions of the license. 
6.2. effect of new versions.
	once covered code has been published under a particular version of the license, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. you may also choose to use such covered code under the terms of any subsequent version of the license published by netscape. no one other than netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to covered code created under this license. 
6.3. derivative works.
	if you create or use a modified version of this license (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already covered code governed by this license), you must (a) rename your license so that the phrases ''mozilla'', ''mozillapl'', ''mozpl'', ''netscape'', "mpl", ''npl'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this license) and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the mozilla public license and netscape public license. (filling in the name of the initial developer, original code or contributor in the notice described in exhibit a shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this license.)
7. disclaimer of warranty. 
8. termination. 
8.2.  if you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against initial developer or a contributor (the initial developer or contributor against whom you file such action is referred to as "participant")  alleging that: 
(a)  such participant's contributor version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such participant to you under sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this license shall, upon 60 days notice from participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice you either: (i)  agree in writing to pay participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for your past and future use of modifications made by such participant, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to the contributor version against such participant.  if within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by participant to you under sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. 
(b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such participant's contributor version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to you by such participant under sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date you first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, modifications made by that participant. 
8.3.  if you assert a patent infringement claim against participant alleging that such participant's contributor version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such participant under sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license. 
8.4.  in the event of termination under sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
9. limitation of liability. 
10. u.s. government end users. 
11. miscellaneous.
